Some ideas of things I want to include, or plan to include, in future versions
of this package.

Outputs:
    [ ] Compile results into Excel workbooks.
    [ ] Compile models into _working_ Excel workbooks.

Functionality:
    [ ] Native "corkscrew" line items (line items that self-reference previous steps).

Misc:
    [ ] Setup CD process to automatically build and release to PyPI
